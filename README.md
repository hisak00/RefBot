# RefBot
RefBot is a discord bot meant for art servers!  
It allows users to upload images using URL links, and to request a random image for a prompt based 
on it's category (people/place/animal/thing). That way your server can have a reference library
that is more personalized, and is easy to access if you are in need of inspiration.
